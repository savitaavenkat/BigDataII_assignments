    "[Active learning](http://tiny.cc/al-wiki) is a certain type of ML algorithms that can train a high-quality ML model with small data-labeling cost. Its basic idea is quite easy to understand. Consider a typical supervised ML problem, which requires a (relatively) large training dataset. In the training dataset, there may be only a small number of data points that are beneficial to the trained ML model. In other words, labeling the small number of data points is enough to train a high-quality ML model. The goal of active learning is to help us to identify the data points. \n",

    "In this assignment, we will revisit [Entity Resolution](https://sfu-db.github.io/bigdata-cmpt733/Lectures/lec2.pdf) and develop an Active Learning approach for it. Recall that entity Resolution (ER) is defined as finding different records that refer to the same real-world entity, e.g., \"iPhone 4-th Generation\" vs. \"iPhone Four\". It is central to data integration and cleaning. The following figure shows the architecture of an entity resolution solution. It consists of four major steps. **I will provide you the source code for Steps 1, 2, 4. Your job is to implement Step 3.**  \n",

You need to implement uncertain sampling for Task A. The algorithm trains an initial model on `labeled_pairs`. Then, it iteratively trains a model. At each iteration, it first applies the model to `unlabeled_pairs`, and makes a prediction on each unlabeled pair along with a probability, where the probability indicates the confidence of the prediction. After that, it selects the most uncertain pair (If there is still a tie, break it randomly),  and call the `crowdsroucing()` function to label the pair. After the pair is labeled, it updates `labeled_pairs` and `unlabeled_pairs`, and then retrain the model on `labeled_pairs`.\n",
